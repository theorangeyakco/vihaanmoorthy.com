                    <p class="beacon-descrip">The brief was a development and bridge in Poplar, a borough in London.
                        Poplar HARCA (Housing and regeneration community
                        association) were looking to unlock the potential of the site available to us. It was a unique
                        opportunity to connect
                        different communities that are currently ‘cut’ off by the Limehouse cut canal.

                        The site is at the centre of Poplar’s most engaging community projects and schools. When Chrisp
                        Street Market realises
                        its full potential the site will become a thoroughfare to the North of the Cut and thus a key
                        destination for the wider
                        public. The design must therefore consider people accessing the building from many different
                        areas, communities and
                        backgrounds as it is at the centre of such a variety of new and old developments. The use of the
                        site for all times of
                        day, and for a variety of different ages and groups of people must be considered. The building
                        will act as community run
                        kitchen and garden, enhancing the park’s biodiversity and act as the largest green space in
                        Poplar. The community garden
                        and workshop aims to educate on the process of growth and the cycle food goes through from land
                        to plate, the economic
                        benefit should only be to sustain the maintenance of the programme and garden. The land
                        available on the site is not
                        large enough to produce vegetation on an industrial scale, but this does not mean a sustainable
                        system is not
                        achievable.

                        Most of the programme needs to interact with both the canal and park. A courtyard scheme
                        connects all of the spaces
                        without creating one large mass. Placing WCs and Thames 21 towards the road allows the building
                        to buffer the central
                        courtyard from the noise of the road. The bridge can link directly to the central zone
                        connecting with a public space on
                        the offside.

                        Key routes through the site created a point at the centre of the site, this becomes a focal
                        point that the bridge and
                        accommodation should focus on. The bridge runs parallel to the tow-path at its central span to
                        better address these key
                        routes, whilst also creating a marina for extra mooring space whilst maintaining two way traffic
                        through the canal.

                        The plan addresses a central axis that connects the offside with Bartlett Park via the bridge
                        proposal. Walkways
                        alongside the buildings create enclosures that draw you towards the accommodation and
                        greenhouses. Secondary axis (from
                        Stinkhouse bridge and Poplar Union) arrive at the central axis underneath bridged walkways which
                        connect the rooftop
                        garden above.

                        The scheme’s form of accommodation around greenhouses lends itself for further expansion, as and
                        when poplar require
                        further functions. With more development we could look at integrating more accommodation into
                        the landscape and
                        potentially evaluate whether a modular construction would be appropriate.</p>
